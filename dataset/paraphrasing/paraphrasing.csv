Your account, specifically. It's quite something, all those posts and comments, a real treasure trove. 

Now, we'd hate for any... accidents to befall such a prized possession. It'd be a real shame if, say, your account suddenly disappeared or fell into the wrong hands. 

Just a friendly reminder that we're always watching. Your account's safety and security are in our hands, and we'd hate for anything bad to happen to it. 

Consider this a gentle nudge to keep things... amicable.""

You're on the hunt for that one guy. \
I get it, I've been there. When he finally came for me, he hit me with some deep truth bombs. He told me I wasn't really seeking him out, but an answer to the ultimate question. \

That question is what brings us together, my friend. It's what led you to this very moment. \
You may not even realize it, but you already know the question, just like I did."""
