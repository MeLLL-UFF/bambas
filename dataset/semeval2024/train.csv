RIP Amir Locke\n22 years old\nVictim of Police Violence\n\nOn Feb 2nd, Amir Locke was asleep on a family member's couch when Minneapolis Police, without announcing themselves, quietly broke in and then stormed the living room with guns drawn. Amir,\ndisoriented and startled, drew his own gun, likely mistaking the police for burglars. He was shot to death on the spot.\nAmir was NOT a suspect to a crime OR named in the MPD search warrant. He was an innocent man and legal gun owner who reacted how any of us would have if their home was broken into. No-knock\nraids, like with Breonna Taylor, are tools of murder.\nThis is what the police do to working-class and people of color.

\Communism provides a positive moment: It is something that makes you do more than criticize and constantly subject everything to a ruthless critique. It provides a purpose and a direction for that sort of negativity to have a positivity in mind. Leftist intellectuals in particular often get lost in\ncritique. We fetishize critique. We enjoy it, in the\npsychoanalytic sense, but the question is: What to do with the critique or how to use it to move forward-to galvanize and organize the masses? What communism provides is an orientation for critique. That is what Marx had, too. Yet, when Marxism moved so strongly into the academy that critique\nbecame viewed as beneficial for its own sake, it lost the orientation to a politics that would be willing to take power.\\n- Jodi Dean;Appealtoauthority

\Human societies are immensely flexible. They can be organised in profoundly different ways, and only detailed analysis can offer valid insights about their internal structure, contradictions, changes and limits. In particular, Marx considers that societies are distinguished by the mode of production under which they are organised, feudalism as opposed to capitalism for example. Each mode of production is structured according to its class relations, for which there are appropriate corresponding categories of analysis. Just as a wage labourer is not a serf who happens to be paid or a \free slave\, so a capitalist is not a feudal baron receiving profit in place of tribute.\\n\nBen Fine and Alfredo Saad-Filho\n;Appealtoauthority,Repetition,Exaggeration/Minimisation,Namecalling/Labeling

When Trump purchased and rebuilt Mar-A-Lago the Grand mansion and estate In Palm beach, Florida he got into a dispute with the city, who are well known for being strict on zoning regulations. Trump put up a 50 foot flag pole even though 30 foot is the maximum allowed. The city imposed a 1,000 dollar fine per day. While Trump and the city argued back and forth, finally when the fine had reached 120,000 dollars Trump proposed a solution. He would donate that amount to veterans organizations,\nwould move the flag and pole to a different location in front of the mansion and would only use a 30 foot flag pole. The city agreed. So Trump brought in the company who does Golf course construction had them build a 20 foot high grassy hill and put a 30 foot flag pole on top of that.....;Glitteringgeneralities(Virtue)

\What a true Leninist and a political conservative have in common is the fact that they reject what one could call liberal Leftist \irresponsibility\ (advocating grand projects of solidarity, freedom, etc., yet ducking out when one has to pay the price for it in the guise of concrete and often \cruel\ political measures):\nlike an authentic conservative, a true Leninist is not afraid to pass to the act, to assume all the consequences, unpleasant as they may be, of realizing his political project. Rudyard Kipling (whom Brecht admired) [...] liberal Leftists reject the Social Democratic \compromise,\ they want a true\nrevolution, yet they shirk the actual price to be paid for it and thus prefer to adopt the attitude of\na Beautiful Soul and to keep their hands clean. In contrast to this false radical Leftist's position\n(which wants true democracy for the people, but without the secret police to fight counterrevolution,\nwithout their academic privileges being threatened), a Leninist, like a Conservative, is authentic in the\nsense of fully assuming the consequences of his choice, i.e. of being fully aware of what it\nactually means to take power and to exert it.\ - Slavoj Žižek;Appealtoauthority,LoadedLanguage,Whataboutism,Glitteringgeneralities(Virtue),Namecalling/Labeling
